# Stitched-By-Gigi
 
## Overview
Stitched By Gigi is an online shopping site for a small local business. Users can shop directly from the site, link to the shop's Etsy page or read the blog. This site was created for an assignment in a web development course. 

## Features
- eCommerce integration via Ecwid
- Bootstrap 
- JavaScript animations

## Biggest Challenge
I thought the eCommerce portion would be the hardest part of this assignment, but the Ecwid integration proved to be pretty simple. This was my first time using Bootstrap, and it was challenging getting to know the intricacies of that framework while also customizing it so the site doesn't look too "Bootstrappy."

## Technologies
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Built in DreamWeaver
